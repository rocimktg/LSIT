With over 100 years of combined experience, they share their passion and uphold Taekwondo's tenets through dedicated instruction. Owner / Head Instructor Master David Kestenbaum 7th Degree Black Belt United States Taekwondo Grandmasters Society & Kukkiwon 6th Dan Master David Kestenbaum has dedicated his life to Taekwondo since age 5. Now a 7th degree Black Belt certified by the Kukkiwon world headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, and the United States Taekwondo Grand Masters Society, he combines world-class competitive experience with a passion for developing students of all ages. Background & Training At 24, Master Kestenbaum was recognized as one of the youngest Taekwondo Masters in the world. Over more than 20 years of study, he has trained on two continents and mentored under Grand Master Won Chik Park, Grand Master Roy Kurban, and Grand Master Martin Hall, along with five additional Masters and numerous Olympic and National Team athletes. Competition Achievements Master Kestenbaum has competed successfully in National and International competitions in both Karate and Olympic Style Taekwondo, winning multiple Texas State titles as well as U.S. and Canadian championships.

With over 500 trophies and medals to his name, he continues to compete in the Texas Karate League where he has won over 25 Grand Championships in forms and sparring. Education & Teaching Philosophy A graduate of the University of Texas Arlington with a bachelor's degree in exercise science, Master Kestenbaum has trained athletes from youth to professional levels. He brings a deep passion for Taekwondo, fitness, and helping people reach their greatest potential to every class he teaches. “Our mission has always been simple — to build stronger people, not just stronger kicks. Taekwondo is a lifelong pursuit of balance, respect, and courage, and we’re honored to guide each student on that journey.” - Master David Kestenbaum Program Director / Head Instructor Master Jenny Yu 5th Degree Black Belt Cliff Nelson Rec. Center • Dottie Lynn Rec.

She has a passion for Taekwondo, education, and encouraging others to be the best they can be. “Taekwondo teaches more than movement — it teaches order, focus, and the quiet confidence that comes from understanding how to improve one step at a time. My goal is to help every student find joy in that process.” - Master Jenny Yu Program Director / Head Instructor Master Bradford Woods 5th Degree Black Belt Elzie Odom Recreation Center Master Bradford Woods discovered Taekwondo the same way many parents do—watching his son take class. What began as support from the sidelines quickly became a personal passion when he decided to jump in and train alongside him. Now a 5th degree black belt, Master Woods leads the program at the Elzie Odom branch of Lone Star Institute of Taekwondo. Competition Achievements Master Woods has been ranked in the top ten competitors of the Traditional Karate League three times and has earned numerous medals, trophies, and accolades throughout his martial arts journey. Community Leadership Beyond the dojang, Master Woods has a long history of serving his community. He has coached youth football, served as vice president of the Seguin High School Band Booster Club, and remains an active leader in his church. He currently works for McCormick & Co. “Discipline and respect are not just values we recite — they’re habits we build through consistent effort. Whether on the mat or in life, Taekwondo reminds us that the best victories come from perseverance and humility.” - Master Bradford Woods Instructor Master Joseph Louis 5th Degree Black Belt Cliff Nelson Rec. Center • Dottie Lynn Rec. Center Master Joseph Louis has been dedicated to Taekwondo for over two decades, beginning his journey in 1999 at the Dottie Lynn Recreation Center under Master Henry.

He brings patience, dedication, and a deep understanding of the challenges students face on their path to black belt. Professional Life Master Louis is employed by the United States Postal Service, balancing his professional career with his passion for teaching and training in Taekwondo. “I tell my students that Taekwondo is a long road, but it’s never a lonely one. Every kick, every correction, every small win is shared — that’s what makes this art a family and not just a sport.” - Master Joseph Louis
